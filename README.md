sling-reactor
=============

Using the latest Sling 7 (trunk) is required. The Apache sling 6 launchpad appears to be outdated in several aspects.

After building Sling 7 successfully
  - run create_users and
  - mvn install -PwithInitialContent

This will provide a basic set of groups and users to play around with.
